# Lorenz-Attractor
A 3d animated simulation of the Lorenz Attractor

As part of the famous Chaos theory, while attempting to simulate weather, Lorenz formulated three ODEs:
dx/dt = sigma * (y - x)
dy/dt = x * (rho - z) - y
dz/dt = x * y - beta * z

The math behind this is explained clearly in the "Math.md" file. This is an attempt at the simulation of the butterfly effect.
